My first thought after I started to learn about JavaScript was that it has some similarities in its basic syntax compared to other languages I have learned before, such as Java, C, and C++. For example, the basic four arithmetic operations are of course  the same, and it was found that the for and switch statements are almost the same in terms of the way conditions are specified and return values are specified. On the other hand, the fact that it was not necessary to specify the type in advance in declaring and assigning variables was found to be different from other Java and C languages. In the languages I have learned so far, it was necessary to specify data types such as char, int, double, etc., depending on the variable to be assigned. In JavaScript, I felt that declarations such as “let var =” could be used to dynamically type any variable, making it easier for programmers to write code.

In the process of learning JavaScript, I have found the WOD, the practice of actually writing code to print a given result, to be very effective in helping us acquire JavaScript skills. Just inputting information on basic JavaScript writing and syntax at freeCodeCamp and the like is not practical, and actually thinking for myself and outputting the information to meet the introduction is effective practice. Finding more ways to improve from basic knowledge to practical skills is important for my future use of JavaScript, so I will try to find more effective method.
